# list OverLap https://www.practicepython.org/exercises/
'''Take two lists, say for example these two:

  a = [1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89]
  b = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13]
and write a program that returns a list that contains only the elements that are common between the lists
(without duplicates). Make sure your program works on two lists of different sizes.

Extras:

1. Randomly generate two lists to test this
2. Write this in one line of Python (don’t worry if you can’t figure this out at this point - we’ll get to it soon) '''

a = [1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89]
b = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13]

common_list = []
for value in a:
    if value in b and value not in common_list:
        common_list.append(value)

print(common_list)

print("\n using single line of code \n")

common_list = print(list(set(a).intersection(set(b))))
